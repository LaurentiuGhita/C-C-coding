Backtracking notes

- model the search solution as a vector a = (a1, .. an)
- at each step we try to extend the partial solution a = (a1, .. ak) 
  by adding another el
    --> after adding we mst test if what we have is a solution
            yes --> print or count it
            no --> check if partial solution is still extensible

- view it as a DFS
